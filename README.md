### Hi, I'm Osvaldo Francesca 👋

I am a **Computer Engineering Student** based in Italy.

My approach to coding is simple: **I build things to understand how they work.**

---

### 💻 What I'm actually working on

Instead of just following tutorials, I try to build complete systems from scratch to learn the core engineering principles:

* **Game Development:** Exploring advanced C++ mechanics, gameplay systems, and engine architecture in **Unreal Engine 5**.
* **Backend & Security:** Building **secure web architectures** to master session management, relational databases, and authentication flows (like 2FA) without relying on heavy frameworks.
* **AI & Computer Vision:** Experimenting with **Python & Deep Learning** libraries to apply computer vision models to real-world data analysis.

### 🛠 My Current Stack

These are the tools I actually use and study:

* **Core:** C++, Python, PHP
* **Engine:** Unreal Engine 5
* **Web:** HTML/CSS, JavaScript, SQL
* **Tools:** Git, Visual Studio, OpenCV
