### Hi, I'm Osvaldo Francesca 👋

I am a **Computer Engineering Student** based in Italy.

My approach to coding is simple: **I build things to understand how they work.**

### 💻 What I'm actually working on

* **Game Development:** Exploring procedural generation and C++ mechanics in **Unreal Engine 5** (see my *Animated Dungeon*).
* **Backend & Security:** I built a **Banking System simulation** (GNB) to learn how to handle secure sessions, SQL databases, and 2FA logic without frameworks.
* **AI & Computer Vision:** I'm experimenting with **Python & YOLO** to analyze video footage and count vehicles in real-time.

### 🛠 My Current Stack

These are the tools I actually use and study:

* **Core:** C++, Python, PHP
* **Engine:** Unreal Engine 5
* **Web:** HTML/CSS, JavaScript, SQL
* **Tools:** Git, Visual Studio, OpenCV
